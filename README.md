# WEB 1st Semester - Frontend/JavaScript

All code related to teaching in client side javascript will be available in this repository.

## Extensions

I will be working with the following extensions in VS Code

1. Live Server (id: "ritwickdey.liveserver") - Quick and easy server for hosting basic html/css/js pages.
2. HTML CSS Support (id: "ecmel.vscode-html-css") - Adds some extra autocomplete for html and css.
3. Prettier (id: "esbenp.prettier-vscode") - Formats your code.
   1. Follow the documentation to get autoformat on save.
4. Code Runner (id: "formulahendry.code-runner") - Allows you to run JavaScript (amongst others) code files directly inside VS Code.
   1. As an alternative [runjs.app](www.runjs.app) can be installed on your computer, also a very decent choice to quickly run some JavaScript locally.

## Dependencies

Our machines has some dependencies/programmes it needs in order to function correctly.

### NodeJS

> [Download link](www.nodejs.org)

The first depedency needed is NodeJS. NodeJS is what you call a "runtime environment", we need to install this in order for our machines to understand JavaScript code.

Usually we see JavaScript code as part of a website, which is where the browser is capable of interpreting the JavaScript code on behalf of our machines.
But when we use Code Runner fx. it does not run in the browser, and therefor we need NodeJS.
